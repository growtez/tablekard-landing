            <h1>Refund & <span class="gold-text">Cancellation</span></h1>
            <p>Our commitment is to provide fresh and high-quality meals. Please review our policy regarding order
                changes and refunds.</p>

            <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>Since this is an in-house dining system designed for immediate preparation, <strong>orders cannot be
                    cancelled once they have been accepted by our kitchen.</strong> We recommend reviewing your cart
                carefully before making payment.</p>

            <h2>2. Order Errors</h2>
            <p>If there is an error in your order (e.g., wrong item served), please notify your table server
                immediately. We will rectify the error by providing the correct item or issuing a credit/refund as
                appropriate.</p>

            <h2>3. Refund Processing</h2>
            <p>In cases where a refund is approved by management, it will be processed through Razorpay back to the
                original payment method. Generally, refunds take 5-7 business days to reflect in your account.</p>

            <h2>4. Quality Issues</h2>
            <p>If you are unsatisfied with the quality of a dish, please speak to our restaurant manager. Refunds for
                quality issues are at the sole discretion of the management.</p>
