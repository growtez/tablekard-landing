            <h1>Terms of <span class="gold-text">Service</span></h1>
            <p>Welcome to Luxe Dine. These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of our
                In-House QR Ordering System.</p>

            <h2>1. In-House Dining Only</h2>
            <p>Our digital ordering system is strictly for customers dining physically inside the restaurant. Orders
                placed through this system will be served to the specific table associated with the QR code scanned.</p>

            <h2>2. Order Acceptance</h2>
            <p>Once an order is placed through the digital menu and payment is confirmed, the order is sent directly to
                our kitchen. We reserve the right to refuse service or cancel orders in case of unforeseen
                circumstances.</p>

            <h2>3. Pricing and Payments</h2>
            <p>All prices listed on the digital menu are inclusive of applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. Payments
                are processed securely via our payment partner, Razorpay.</p>

            <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
            <p>Users must not misuse the QR ordering system or attempt to disrupt its functionality. Any fraudulent
                activity will be reported to the authorities.</p>

            <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Luxe Dine shall not be held responsible for any technical delays or errors in the ordering process,
                although we will make every effort to resolve any issues promptly.</p>
